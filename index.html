									<h2>Game Tips</h2>
								</header>								
								<ul>
									<li>
										Remember to spin the wheel everyday to collect the daily reward which is either (2 to 3 restore health/magic potions) or (1 restore health/magic potion and 1 extra life).
									</li>
									<li>
										Watch the reward video to restore health point and magic energy.
									</li>
									<li>
										Single Sword attack is good against single enemy or maximum 2 enemies.
									</li>
									<li>
										Double Sword attack is good against 2 or maximum 3 enemies.
									</li>
									<li>
										It is <B>NOT</B> advisable to use magic attack when enemies are coming from different directions as the magic attack is likely to affect only a single enemy. It is better to dodge their attacks, go around them and wait for them to group close to each other before using magic on them. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Lightning and fireball magic attacks are good against multiple enemies when they are aligned in a straight line. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Meteor magic attack is an area attack and is good against a group of enemies that are close to each other.
									</li>
									<li>
										Although Meteor, lightning and fireball magic attacks use the same amount of magic energy to execute the attack, fireball magic attack is the most powerful and causes the most damages to the enemies. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Search for extra life and health restore items that are available throughout the game for the player to pick up.
									</li>																		
									<li>
										Pick up the health restore item when both health point and magic energy are low. When health point is low but magic energy is still high, use magic attack even on single enemy. On the other hand, if magic energy is low and health point is still high, use sword attack even when there are 3 or more enemies.
									</li>																		
									<li>
										If possible, try to lure an enemy to a remote place and fight against the enemy individually rather than take on all enemies at the same time.
									</li>
									<li>
										The best strategy against suicide bombers is to dodge their attacks so that they kill themselves by their bomb attack rather than attack them directly.
									</li>
									<li>
										Generally, when fighting against an enemy with magic power, for example the boss, it is <B>NOT</B> advisable to use sword attacks continuously on the enemy as such attacks can only be executed at close range. As a result, it is difficult to dodge the enemy's magic attack. It is better to maintain a distance with the enemy, wait for the enemy to execute an attack and dodge the attack if required. After the enemy's attack, the player can then quickly return 2 to 3 sword attacks against the enemy and move back. Repeat this attack pattern until the enemy is killed.
									</li>
